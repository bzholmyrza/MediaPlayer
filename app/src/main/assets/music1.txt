Beside me I want you (Forever in my mind)
I want that more than anything in this world (Only you)
I want you to fight like hell to stay with us (The pieces in my heart)
(Go away with you)
With everybody else gone I know it might not be what you wanted (Forever in my mind, only you)
But we worked too hard for you to keep fighting so (The pieces in my heart)
If you wanna go (Run away with you)
I want you to know it's okay (Forever in my mind)

I was all alone on my own, it's okay though
Do you really love me, do you really trust me? (The pieces in my heart)
I was doing bad feeling sad, feeling sorry (Go away with you)
Now you're really gone and I can't get you to call me (Forever in my mind)

Wanna run away, fuck this love and fuck this place (Only you)
If you was a ghost I would kiss you anyway (The pieces in my heart)
I can't feel my lungs feeling like I'm outta space (Run away with you)
You're the one I love but you're the one I hate (Forever in my mind)

I can't really see you with anyone else (Only you)
All these fucking perky's not good for my health (The pieces in my heart)
Wanna end it all I can't do this again (Run away with you)
Tell her that I love her, she do it for him (Forever in my mind)

I can't really see you with anyone else (Only you)
All these fucking perky's not good for my health (The pieces in my heart)
Wanna end it all I can't do this again (Run away with you)
Tell her that I love her, she do it for him

(Forever in my mind, only you)
(The pieces in my heart go away with you)
(Forever in my mind, only you)
(The pieces in my heart run away with you)
(Forever)
